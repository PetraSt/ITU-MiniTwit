**Repository Setup**
The team will develop the project locally and push the changes to remote repository stored on Github. The remote repository is public and available to clone and fork by anyone.

**Branching**
The rules for developing new features are as follow:
- all developers have to create new branch for new feature locally and on remote repository
- all developers must push their changes to remote repository and create pull request to merge their changes to main branch
- all pull requests have to be approved by at least one collaborator in order to merge the branch

**Responsibility**
The rules have to be followed by all memebers of the team and all must contribute by code and reviews.

**Git Workflow**
We decided on using centralized workflow model.
In centralized systems, there is generally a single collaboration model — the centralized workflow. One central hub, or repository, can accept code, and everyone synchronizes their work with it.

**Contribution**
All team memebers shoould report bugs and missing features. Also write tests for new implementations, update depenedencies and documentation if needed.
